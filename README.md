Carousel work - Version 1
=========================

This is a quick build using the carousel plugin bxslider built by Steven Wanderski and can be downloaded from http://bxslider.com/

I have adapted the carousel to use the following styles to show the first image horizontally centered and to allow the visibility of other slides.

This will also work on a mobile device by showing just the one image until at a reasonable sized screen where will show the other slides.
